## Project Description
This is my indepentent project to showcase the lesson learned last week: Arrays and Loops. It is an application that will take a number from a user and will return a range of numbers and statements using arrays and loops. A user should be able to enter a new number and see different results over and over again.
## Specs
 
```
Describe: beepBop()
Test: "It should return an array of numbers inputted by the user including the number 0"
Expect(beepBoop(08234)).toEqual(["08234"]);
 ```
